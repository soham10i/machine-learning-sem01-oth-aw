Here is a detailed step-by-step approach to tackling the project as per the requirements and using the research paper:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Dataset**
- **Objective:** Gain familiarity with the dataset (specifically for Wind Farm B) to comprehend its structure and content.
- **Actions:**
  - Load the dataset and examine the metadata, features, and labels.
  - Identify the 257 features, including sensor measurements and status information.
  - Inspect data quality: missing values, anomalies, and inconsistencies (e.g., 0-values and inconsistent status values).
  - Validate the data's suitability for anomaly detection, ensuring it meets the requirements for anomaly event labels, normal behavior representation, and temporal consistency.

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
- **Objective:** Prepare the dataset for effective machine learning.
- **Actions:**
  - Handle missing values, especially those replaced with zeros.
  - Normalize and scale numerical features for better model performance.
  - Engineer additional features if necessary (e.g., seasonal or trend-related features from timestamps).
  - Assess data imbalances between anomaly events and normal data.
  - Document preprocessing steps comprehensively.

### **Step 3: Data Analysis and Visualization (WP1)**
- **Objective:** Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships and anomalies in the data.
- **Actions:**
  - Visualize sensor measurements, anomalies, and normal data using time series plots.
  - Correlate features to identify redundancies or dependencies.
  - Investigate potential trends or patterns preceding anomaly events.
  - Identify and report any issues or remarkable insights.

### **Step 4: Clustering for Anomaly Categorization (WP2)**
- **Objective:** Use clustering algorithms to identify potential anomaly categories.
- **Actions:**
  - Choose a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering) suitable for time-series data.
  - Optimize hyperparameters through experiments.
  - Evaluate the clustering results by comparing clusters with known anomaly labels.
  - Analyze the usefulness of clustering for anomaly prediction and refine preprocessing if needed.

### **Step 5: Change Point Detection (WP3)**
- **Objective:** Apply change point detection algorithms to detect state changes from normal to anomalous.
- **Actions:**
  - Use the ruptures package as specified.
  - Select an algorithm (e.g., dynamic programming, binary segmentation).
  - Tune parameters to maximize early detection and minimize false positives.
  - Compare results with clustering algorithms and validate them using the dataset's anomaly labels.

### **Step 6: Model Training and Benchmarking**
- **Objective:** Train machine learning models as benchmarks for anomaly detection.
- **Actions:**
  - Use algorithms like autoencoders, isolation forests, or LSTM-based models for anomaly detection.
  - Train on normal behavior data and validate on datasets containing anomalies.
  - Evaluate using the CARE-score (Coverage, Accuracy, Reliability, Earliness) introduced in the research paper.
  - Optimize model hyperparameters using tools like Optuna.

### **Step 7: Result Analysis and Comparison**
- **Objective:** Compare the performance of clustering, change point detection, and ML models.
- **Actions:**
  - Evaluate each method using quantitative metrics (e.g., CARE-score).
  - Discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach.
  - Highlight scenarios where each method is most effective.

### **Step 8: Documentation and Report Writing**
- **Objective:** Create a structured and detailed report.
- **Actions:**
  - Write sections such as Introduction, Relevant Literature, Methods, Experiments, Results, and Discussion.
  - Include all visualizations, preprocessing steps, and model explanations.
  - Document individual contributions for team-based tasks as required.

### **Step 9: Code Structuring and Submission**
- **Objective:** Ensure the code is well-documented and follows the specified guidelines.
- **Actions:**
  - Include appropriate docstrings, comments, and a README file.
  - Ensure the code runs efficiently on the provided GPU lab setup.
  - Validate that all code dependencies are satisfied and included in the submission package.

### **Step 10: Peer Review and Final Refinements**
- **Objective:** Conduct a thorough review of the project deliverables.
- **Actions:**
  - Verify all data, results, and code meet quality standards.
  - Cross-check the documentation for clarity and completeness.
  - Address any gaps or inconsistencies before submission.
