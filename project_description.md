## Task Explanation

The task involves analyzing event data from Wind Farm B to identify anomalies and normal events using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify events based on the provided sensor data and feature descriptions.

## Dataset Explanation

1. **event_info.csv**: This file contains details about various events, including whether they are anomalies or normal events. Each event is identified by a unique `event_id`.

2. **feature_description.csv**: This file provides descriptions of all the sensors and features used in the dataset files. It helps in understanding what each feature represents and how it can be used in the analysis.

3. **2.csv and other dataset files**: These files contain the actual sensor data for different events. Each row corresponds to a specific event and includes various features (sensors' readings) that can be used to classify the event.

## Relationship Between Files

- The `event_info.csv` file uses `event_id` to link to the corresponding rows in the dataset files (e.g., `2.csv`).
- The `feature_description.csv` file explains the columns in the dataset files, providing context for each feature.

## Solving the Project Using ML

To solve this project, you can use various machine learning algorithms to classify events as anomalies or normal events. Here are some possible algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple and interpretable model for binary classification.
2. **Decision Trees**: A model that splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.
3. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method that classifies based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors.
6. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning models that can capture complex patterns in the data.
7. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors of previous models.
8. **Isolation Forest**: Specifically designed for anomaly detection by isolating observations.

The choice of algorithm depends on the dataset's characteristics and the specific requirements of the project. You may need to experiment with different algorithms and tune their hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.

## Concept of Ruptures

Ruptures is a Python library for performing offline change point detection. Change point detection aims to identify times when the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. This is particularly useful in time series analysis where you want to detect shifts in the mean, variance, or other properties of the data.

### Key Features of Ruptures:
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Supports various algorithms for change point detection, including dynamic programming, binary segmentation, and window-based methods.
- **Customizable Cost Functions**: Allows the use of different cost functions to detect changes in mean, variance, or more complex statistical properties.
- **Scalability**: Efficient implementations that can handle large datasets.

### How to Use Ruptures:
1. **Install the Library**: You can install ruptures using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install ruptures
   ```
2. **Load Your Data**: Load your time series data into a numpy array or pandas DataFrame.
3. **Choose a Detection Method**: Select an appropriate change point detection method.
4. **Fit the Model**: Apply the detection method to your data to identify change points.
5. **Analyze Results**: Interpret the detected change points to understand shifts in your data.

Ruptures can be particularly useful in this project to detect anomalies in the sensor data by identifying points where the statistical properties of the data change significantly.
